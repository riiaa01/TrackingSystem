# TrackingSystem
This is a GSM-based GPS tracking system project with added functionalities and improved accuracy of the data points collected. It returns the location coordinates and the google maps link, in case of any of the conditions like the use of push-button, heartbeat rising above 28 bpm or dropping below 20 bpm, and body temperature rising above 29 or dropping below 20 (the conditions of fear/ threat detection). The system displays “All Ok” if all the parameters are normal, however, as any of the events occur the system sends a message to the emergency contact saying “Sensing Danger”. The system further sends the heartbeat and the temperature measurements along with the message mentioning which of the parameters are abnormal, or both if both the temperature and heartbeat are found to be out of range. The location's coordinates and the google maps link to the live location are sent as well to the registered contact.
The data points however received are not accurate and can vary in distance up to 50m. In order to improve the accuracy Kalman's filtering algorithm is used which works on estimation and prediction and updating the model. In machine learning applications, the Kalman filtering algorithm can be used for various tasks such as tracking objects, estimating hidden states in a dynamic system, or filtering noisy sensor measurements. It can also be combined with other machine learning techniques, such as Bayesian inference or reinforcement learning, to enhance state estimation or decision-making processes.
